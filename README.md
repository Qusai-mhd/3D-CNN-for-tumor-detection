# Advanced 3D CNN Model For Early Tumor Detection
## Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) model for early tumor detection in medical imaging data. The model is trained on a large dataset of 3D and 4D medical scans and optimized for high accuracy in detecting tumors at an early stage. The ultimate goal is to assist radiologists in detecting tumors more accurately and efficiently, leading to improved patient outcomes.
Requirements

## To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries installed on your machine:

    Python 3.x
    Conda
    Pytorch 2.x
    Keras
    nibabel
    Matplotlib
    Torchio

## Data

The model is trained on a dataset of 3D and 4D medical scans, this medical dataset is provided by [Medical Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/). However, you can use any 3D medical imaging data of your own to fine-tune the model and apply it to new cases.
Usage

### To train the model on your own data, follow these steps:

    Preprocess the data and split it into training and validation sets.
    Modify the hyperparameters in the 03-train.ipynb script to match your data and desired model performance.
    Run the 03-train.ipynb script to train the model.
    Use the 03-train.ipynb script to apply the trained model to new cases and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The model has been validated on a test dataset and achieved high accuracy in detecting tumors at an early stage. The results are reported in the accompanying research paper.
